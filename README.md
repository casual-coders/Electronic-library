# Electronic-library

## Abstract:

This readMe file, before serving as an introduction to our project, it’s a living statement for high call from Allah almighty, in Quran chapter 96, The first word chosen by Allah (swt) to be communicated to humanity was ‘Read’.
Reading has always been a part of every intellectual society. Yet, this command was not given to a society full of libraries and universities or a society with a history of books. The prophet (saw) was unlettered as were the vast majority of people in this society. Poetry was a feature of their society but even then, it was seldom in a written form, rather, it was memorized. To this society Allah (swt) gave the commandment of reading and amazingly in response to this command the Muslims became one of the most educated civilizations in history.

That been said; we, as _*“Zed Shelves”*_, we took it upon ourselves to spread this commandment of reading, and facilitate reading for everyone, by providing a virtual library, a safe sanctuary to book lovers.

Due to vast spread of Covid 19 in the world as a whole, and in Jordan in particular, we found ourselves “as humanity” compelled to practice social distancing, staying at home at all costs ,, but that shouldn’t come between us and continue Reading books , this project will put an ease to book lovers , and allow them to proceed reading “Online” instead of risking their lives going to physical bookstore to order a book , it’s a different approach to read books, but the experience itself will stay intact.


## Description:

There exists an abundance of books on people's shelves that aren't constantly being read by the owners, and a scarcity of said books in the markets, our project aims to create a digital platform for people willing to share their books and receive free books from others for a low sum.
